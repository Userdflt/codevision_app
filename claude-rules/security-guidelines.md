# Security Guidelines for Code Vision App

## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Token Handling
- Always validate JWT tokens before processing requests
- Use proper token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Validate token signatures against Supabase public keys
- Implement proper token revocation checks
- Never log JWT tokens or their contents

### User Access Control
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Separate admin and user privileges
- Validate user permissions for each request
- Use principle of least privilege
- Implement session timeout mechanisms

### API Security
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate all input parameters
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement request/response logging (without sensitive data)

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Never log user queries containing personal information
- Implement data minimization principles
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implement secure data deletion for ephemeral sessions

### Query Data Security
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Prevent injection attacks in vector queries
- Validate query parameters and limits
- Implement output encoding for responses
- Monitor for potential data leaks in responses

### Session Management
- Use secure session storage
- Implement proper session cleanup
- Avoid storing sensitive data in sessions
- Use secure cookie attributes
- Implement concurrent session limits

## Infrastructure Security

### Environment Configuration
- Use different configurations for dev/staging/production
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use secure secret management systems
- Implement proper environment isolation
- Regular security updates for all dependencies

### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Use connection pooling with proper limits
- Monitor database access patterns
- Implement backup encryption

### API Gateway Security
- Implement request validation
- Use proper error handling (no information disclosure)
- Add security headers to all responses
- Implement timeout configurations
- Monitor API usage patterns

## LLM Security

### Prompt Injection Prevention
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use system message boundaries
- Implement input length limits
- Monitor for prompt manipulation attempts
- Separate user content from system instructions

### Output Validation
- Validate LLM responses before returning to users
- Check for potential information leaks
- Implement content filtering
- Monitor response patterns for anomalies
- Log security-relevant events

### Provider Security
- Use API keys securely (environment variables)
- Implement proper error handling for LLM failures
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Rotate API keys regularly

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Log all authentication attempts

- Regular access reviews and cleanup
- Secure development environment setup
- Code signing and verification

## Privacy Protection

### Data Minimization
- Collect only necessary user data
- Implement data retention policies
- Provide user data deletion mechanisms
- Minimize cross-border data transfers
- Document data processing activities

### User Rights
- Implement data access rights
- Provide data portability options
- Respect user privacy preferences
- Clear privacy policy communication
- Cookie and tracking consent management

### Compliance Requirements
- Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) compliance
- GDPR considerations for international users
- Sector-specific privacy requirements
- Regular privacy impact assessments
- Privacy by design principles

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Stop ongoing threats
4. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Improve security measures

### Data Breach Response
1. **Detection**: Identify potential breach
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope and severity
3. **Notification**: Inform relevant authorities and users
4. **Remediation**: Fix vulnerabilities
5. **Documentation**: Record incident and response

### System Compromise Response
1. **Isolation**: Disconnect affected systems
2. **Preservation**: Preserve evidence
3. **Investigation**: Determine attack vectors
4. **Recovery**: Rebuild from clean backups
5. **Strengthening**: Improve defenses
